+Limit the query to packages of given architecture(s). Valid values are all
+architectures known to rpm/yum such as 'i386' and 'src' for
+source RPMS. Note that repoquery will now change yum's "arch" to the first
+value in the archlist. So "\-\-archlist=i386,i686" will change yum's canonical
+arch to i386, but allow packages of i386 and i686.

 Yumdownloader inherits all other options from yum. See the yum(8) man page
